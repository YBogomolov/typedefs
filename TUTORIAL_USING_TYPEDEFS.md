# Tutorial: Using Typedefs

In this tutorial we are going to demonstrate how to use typedefs. We will show how to add type
definitions to an existing haskell project and make changes to it.

## The skeleton

First you will need to clone the [skeleton project](PROJ), it is a Haskell project for a 
server uinsg [servant](SERVANT) to generate the routes. Servant allows us to write simple
type defintions that declaratively describe our routes
